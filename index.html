### Hints * Use Bootstrap's grid system (containers, rows, and columns). * On an
`xs` screen, content should take up the entire screen. On `sm` and larger
screens, you should have some margins on the left and right sides of the screen.
Check out various sites on your mobile device vs. your computer to see examples
of these differences. * Use an HTML validation service to ensure that each page
has valid HTML. ### Minimum Requirements * Functional, deployed application *
GitHub repository with README describing the project * Navbar must be consistent
on each page. * Navbar on each page must contain links to Home/About, Contact,
and Portfolio pages. * All links must work. * Must use semantic html. * Each
page must have valid and correct HTML. (use a validation service) * Must contain
your personalized information. (bio, name, images, links to social media, etc.)
* Must properly utilize Bootstrap components and grid system. ### Bonus * Using
Bootstrap, make a sticky footer and use sub-rows and sub-columns on your
portfolio site (**Hint:** Check out the Bootstrap documentation). ## Commit
Early and Often One of the most important skills to master as a web developer is
version control. Building the habit of committing via Git is important for two
reasons: * Your commit history is a signal to employers that you are actively
working on projects and learning new skills. * Your commit history allows you to
revert your codebase in the event that you need to return to a previous state.
Follow these guidelines for committing: * Make single-purpose commits for
related changes to ensure a clean, manageable history. If you are fixing two
issues, make two commits. * Write descriptive, meaningful commit messages so
that you and anyone else looking at your repository can easily understand its
history. * Don't commit half-done work, for the sake of your collaborators (and
your future self!). * Test your application before you commit to ensure
functionality at every step in the development process. We would like you to
have well over 200 commits by graduation, so commit early and often! ##
