# My Portfolio

Resources:
put in bootstrap credit

## Description 

This site holds my personal portfolio. It is built according to the requirements of Georgia Tech's Full Stack Flex Program's homework assignment.

I built it using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. I then adjusted styling to match the example provided in class.
